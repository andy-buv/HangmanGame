Notes on Hangman.

The aim of the game is to guess the answer before you are hung.
You are hung if you make 11 incorrect guesses.


So we start with a dictionary. Get a friend to pick a word and make sure it is in the dictionary and so it isn't made up.

Got your word? Great. Now write a dash '_' for each letter in that word.

e.g. trouble = _ _ _ _ _ _ _ .

now start guessing letters.
